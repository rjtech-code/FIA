// caller/API needs to send (or can override) a tour selection.
//
// Computed lazily (not a module-load-time constant) — ENABLED_TOURS is a
// live, in-place-refreshed array (see constants/tours.js), so a tour
// created/deleted after this module first loaded must be picked up on the
// very next batch start, not frozen at whatever ENABLED_TOURS held at

// simply ignored; nothing depends on it). Repeat submissions for the same
// grade never overwrite or get rejected — they merge into the same
// document: student count adds up, tours union (no duplicates, and picks up
// any newly-enabled tour on a later top-up), and month/financialYear move
// forward to the latest submission.
// `language` is no longer collected from the teacher (the "In which
// language did students watch the Career Tour?" question was removed from
// the Start Feedback form) — still accepted here and passed through as-is
// if an older/other caller happens to send one, but never required, and
